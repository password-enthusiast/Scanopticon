&&&VIBE CODE DISCLAIMER&&&& Scanopticon uses brute-force technique of "fuzzing" to create different possible URLs for IP camera streams. The user inputs an IP range, ports, and paths. The program generates all unique combinations of these IPs, ports, and paths and sends a GET request to each. The results are then logged in the format displayed in scan_log.csv.

*The CLI is actually just a script. Oops!*
